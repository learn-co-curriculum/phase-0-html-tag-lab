# Your First HTML Tag Lab

## Learning Goals

- Code an `h1` tag
- Set the inner text of the `h1` to `Hello, World!`

## Introduction

So far, we've seen how to markup content with HTML, how to structure an HTML
document and what HTML tags look like. Now let's focus on writing a single HTML
tag from scratch and examining each of its parts.

## Getting Started

**Fork and clone** this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code. Run `npm test` as you go to see your test progress.

## Code an `h1` Tag

Open `index.html` in your text editor. Add the `h1` opening and closing tags.

## Set the Inner Text

Inside of the opening and closing `h1` tags, insert the text: `Hello, World!`.

Check your progress by running `npm test`. Failing tests will provide helpful
error messages that you can use to debug your code â€” read them closely for
hints!

### Viewing Your Work in the Browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your
browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual
layout in the browser.

You can open `index.html` a few ways, depending on the environment you are in:

For Mac users:

- Open from the Terminal by running `open index.html` in the root directory of
  this lab
- Use Finder to navigate to this lab's local folder and click the `index.html`
  file

For WSL users:

- Open from Ubuntu by running `explorer.exe index.html` in the root directory of
  this lab
- Open a new Explorer window. There is a bar that says "Quick Access" along the
  top of the window (similar to a URL bar in a browser). Click this and type
  `\\wsl$` to access files and folders on Ubuntu. Navigate to
  `/home/<your-user-name>/` to get to your home directory, then locate this
  lab's local folder and click the `index.html` file.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it
in a text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the
changes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You wrote your first HTML tag. Now you can use your knowledge
of this basic building block to learn more HTML tags and see how they work with
each other to create an entire HTML document structure. Remember to submit your
work in CodeGrade before moving on.
